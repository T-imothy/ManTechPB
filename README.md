# ManTechPB

ManTechPB is a standalone in-game manager for CMaNGOS PlayerBots. It provides a compact interface for party and individual bot control, role and talent setup, combat behavior, formations, loot policy, advanced class controls, and a movable bot bar.

This project is a modern standalone successor inspired by the original [Mangosbot UI addon by ike3](https://github.com/ike3/mangosbot-addon). Full credit and thanks go to ike3 and the original addon contributors for pioneering the in-game PlayerBots control interface. ManTechPB is built for the actively maintained [CMaNGOS PlayerBots project](https://github.com/cmangos/playerbots).
